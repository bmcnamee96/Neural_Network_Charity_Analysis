# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview
- The purpose of this analysis was to determine the application types and the classification of charity applications.

## Results
- The target variables are application type and classification.
- The variables that are considered a feature are special considerations.
- Variables that should be removed are organization and affiliation

- I selected 2 hidden nodes for layer 1 and 4 for layer 2.  I noticed that this was enough to get an accuracy of above 92%

## Summary
- This model does a great job at classifying this dataset.  It has a high accuracy and a low loss. After about 10 epochs we were at the max for the model.
